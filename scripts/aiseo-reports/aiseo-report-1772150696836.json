Results-First We measure success by outcomes, not activity. Every dollar you invest should bring back more in return. No-Nonsense Clear communication, upfront prices, realistic timelines. No corporate jargon, no hidden fees. Fast & Flexible We move fast and scale with your business. No bureaucracy, no endless approval chains. Our Story AMP Marketing was built by the same team behind Prime Marketing Experts . With Michael Krieger at the helm, our core mission hasn't changed: help businesses grow through smart, results-driven marketing. Michael founded Prime Marketing Experts back in 2017. He grew up in Boston, graduated from UMass Lowell, and has spent the better part of his career helping businesses scale. Along the way, he saw something clearly: AI had reached a point where it could make marketing faster and far more affordable for everyday businesses. AMP Marketing is the result of that realization. We took everything we learned at Prime and combined it with AI tools that deliver qualified leads in days, not months. Today we serve over 500 businesses nationwide. Whether you're a plumber or a law firm, you get the same attention to detail and focus on results that Michael has brought to every project since day one. The AMP Marketing Difference Fair Pricing You know exactly what you're paying for. No surprise fees, and you can cancel whenever you want. Measurable Results We track every lead so you always know whether your investment is paying off. Fast Setup Most projects launch within a week. No waiting months to see results. Real Support Questions? Send us an email. Real people manage your account and respond quickly. Let us Get to Work → What Our Clients Say We scaled from 10 leads a month to over 100 in just 8 weeks. The chatbot generates leads around the clock while we focus on running the business. Mike R. HVAC Company Owner We've worked with several agencies before, but none delivered this fast. More patients showed interest in month one than we saw all of last year. Sarah L. Dental Practice We went from invisible on Google to the top of the local map pack. The phone rings nonstop with people wanting to book reservations. James T. Local Restaurant Owner The AI voice receptionist keeps paying for itself every month. We used to lose 20% of calls because nobody could pick up. Amanda K. Law Firm Email automation transformed our business. We used to spend hours every week on manual follow-ups. Now it runs itself, and our close rate is up 40%. David M. Real Estate Agency Our landing page generated $47,000 in revenue during its first month. Not a typo. Best marketing investment we've ever made. Jennifer P. E-commerce Business Success Stories Case Studies Real numbers from real clients. No marketing fluff. Success Story HVAC Company This HVAC company was pulling about 15 leads a month from their website. The business relied almost entirely on referrals and word of mouth. The Solution We installed a 24/7 AI chatbot for lead capture, optimized their Google Business profile, and built landing pages targeting the areas they serve. The Results Eight weeks later: over 100 leads in a single month. That's a 567% increase. Their cost per lead dropped 62%, and the chatbot now books appointments automatically. I wasn't sure at first, but they delivered. Our phone hasn't stopped ringing since. HVAC Company Success Story Dental Practice A new dental clinic struggling to fill chairs. Too many no-shows, and their online reviews were a mess. The Solution We set up an AI-powered phone scheduler plus automated follow-up emails to confirm appointments and request patient feedback. The Results Month one: 47 new patient appointments. No-shows dropped 73%. They hit a 4.8-star rating with over 120 reviews. Our staff saves 10+ hours every week with the automation, and patient flow has been incredible. Dental Practice",

Tell us what you need, and we'll put together a package that fits your situation. How quickly will this actually work? Depends on the service. Chatbots can start capturing leads on day one. SEO takes a few months to build momentum. Most clients see noticeable results within the first week or two. Do I have to sign a long contract? Month-to-month billing. If you want to cancel, give us 30 days notice. No long-term contracts, no traps. Want to See If This Actually Works? 7 days free. No card required. Walk away anytime if it's not your thing.

          "fullContent": "AI Assisted Leadgen Most lead funnels fail in one of two ways: they overwhelm visitors with too many form fields, or they go silent after the first touchpoint. Our AI-powered funnels guide prospects from first click to booked appointment—without dropping a single lead. Why AI Assisted Leadgen Works Better We build lead funnels that turn prospects into booked appointments. Here's how the system works: First, we identify a lead magnet your target customers can't resist—a checklist, guide, calculator, or resource they'll download without hesitation. Next, we design a landing page built for conversions. We target 20% conversion rates or higher. Most agencies celebrate 5%—we don't stop there. Then we create an email sequence that reads like a personal conversation, not a mass blast. Each message nurtures leads progressively until they're ready for a call. By syncing with your calendar, we skip the back-and-forth email threads and let qualified leads book time with you directly. We also handle all the tracking. You'll see exactly what's working and where to improve—no guesswork. Pricing $1,499 setup + $299/mo Complete lead generation system Transparent pricing. We build the system, manage it, and keep your pipeline full. Get Started Most customers get their first qualified lead in under a week. Three Channels, One System Most businesses only use one or two of these channels. We connect all three so you capture every lead—no matter where a prospect first discovers you. Website Chatbot Engages visitors at the right moment, asks qualifying questions, and books appointments—all on autopilot, 24/7. Never miss a lead again Facebook Messenger 1.3 billion people use Messenger every month. Reach prospects on a platform they already use and trust—with instant, automated responses. Instant response, any time of day LinkedIn Automation Finds prospects who match your criteria, engages with their content through meaningful comments and shares, and starts conversations that lead to sales. Warm introductions at scale Common Questions Is this chatbot different from the one I already have? Most chatbots handle basic FAQ-style questions and stop there. Ours is a sales tool. It qualifies visitors through a natural conversation, collects their contact information, and books appointments on your calendar—without you lifting a finger. One client told us their old bot felt like a vending machine. Ours works more like a top sales rep who never clocks out. What if I already have a CRM? We integrate with all major CRM platforms—HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, and more. Every conversation and data point flows directly into your existing setup. Your team gets full visibility, and leads never have to repeat themselves. Facebook Messenger sounds complicated. Is it? Not at all—this is one of our strengths. Here's a typical scenario: someone messages your Facebook page at 3 AM. Your AI assistant responds instantly, asks a few qualifying questions, and if they're a fit, books a call at their convenience. They pick a slot from your calendar, and it's done. You wake up to a calendar full of qualified appointments. I have tried LinkedIn automation before and it felt spammy. We understand that concern completely. Generic bots that blast the same message to everyone are ineffective and damage your reputation. Our approach is different. We identify individuals who match your ideal customer profile, engage with their content through thoughtful and relevant comments, and then open genuine conversations. The result is warm introductions—not cold spam. How long does it take to see the results? Timeline depends on your current traffic levels. That said, most clients see their first qualified lead within the first week. The system also improves over time—it learns what converts best for your specific business. By week three or four, you'll typically have a steady flow of leads coming in without any extra effort on your end. What if I want to change things after the launch? During the first month, all modifications are included at no extra cost. After that, changes are billed at reasonable hourly rates. We don't disappear after launch—you'll get regular updates on performance and optimizations. Most clients stay with us not because of a contract, but because the system delivers consistent results. The Number One Reason Leads Get Lost It's response time. If a lead doesn't hear back within 5 minutes, the chance of conversion drops by 10x. People get distracted, lose interest, or find a competitor who responded faster. One gym owner we work with put it this way: \"I was losing 5 to 10 leads every week because I couldn't respond fast enough. Now I wake up to appointments already on my calendar.\" Book Your Discovery Call 15 minutes, no pressure. We'll discuss your goals and see if we're the right fit.",

              "fullText": "AI Assisted Leadgen Most lead funnels fail in one of two ways: they overwhelm visitors with too many form fields, or they go silent after the first touchpoint. Our AI-powered funnels guide prospects from first click to booked appointment—without dropping a single lead. Why AI Assisted Leadgen Works Better We build lead funnels that turn prospects into booked appointments. Here's how the system works: First, we identify a lead magnet your target customers can't resist—a checklist, guide, calculator, or resource they'll download without hesitation. Next, we design a landing page built for conversions. We target 20% conversion rates or higher. Most agencies celebrate 5%—we don't stop there. Then we create an email sequence that reads like a personal conversation, not a mass blast. Each message nurtures leads progressively until they're ready for a call. By syncing with your calendar, we skip the back-and-forth email threads and let qualified leads book time with you directly. We also handle all the tracking. You'll see exactly what's working and where to improve—no guesswork. Pricing $1,499 setup + $299/mo Complete lead generation system Transparent pricing. We build the system, manage it, and keep your pipeline full. Get Started Most customers get their first qualified lead in under a week. Three Channels, One System Most businesses only use one or two of these channels. We connect all three so you capture every lead—no matter where a prospect first discovers you. Website Chatbot Engages visitors at the right moment, asks qualifying questions, and books appointments—all on autopilot, 24/7. Never miss a lead again Facebook Messenger 1.3 billion people use Messenger every month. Reach prospects on a platform they already use and trust—with instant, automated responses.",

Warm introductions at scale Common Questions Is this chatbot different from the one I already have? Most chatbots handle basic FAQ-style questions and stop there. Ours is a sales tool. It qualifies visitors through a natural conversation, collects their contact information, and books appointments on your calendar—without you lifting a finger. One client told us their old bot felt like a vending machine. Ours works more like a top sales rep who never clocks out. What if I already have a CRM? We integrate with all major CRM platforms—HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, and more. Every conversation and data point flows directly into your existing setup. Your team gets full visibility, and leads never have to repeat themselves. Facebook Messenger sounds complicated. Is it? Not at all—this is one of our strengths. Here's a typical scenario: someone messages your Facebook page at 3 AM. Your AI assistant responds instantly, asks a few qualifying questions, and if they're a fit, books a call at their convenience. They pick a slot from your calendar, and it's done. You wake up to a calendar full of qualified appointments. I have tried LinkedIn automation before and it felt spammy.

Sometimes a small tweak is all it takes. Other times, a full rewrite makes the difference. How do you know if it’s working? We track clicks, conversions, and cost per lead. When results go up and costs go down, it’s working. We don’t chase vanity metrics. Want to stop wasting your ad budget? One dental client cut their cost per lead by 40% in the first month. Better copy, less waste. Get Better Copy",

Our Story AMP Marketing was built by the same team behind Prime Marketing Experts . With Michael Krieger at the helm, our core mission hasn't changed: help businesses grow through smart, results-driven marketing. Michael founded Prime Marketing Experts back in 2017.

We took everything we learned at Prime and combined it with AI tools that deliver qualified leads in days, not months. Today we serve over 500 businesses nationwide.

          "fullContent": "AI Assisted Leadgen Most lead funnels fail in one of two ways: they overwhelm visitors with too many form fields, or they go silent after the first touchpoint. Our AI-powered funnels guide prospects from first click to booked appointment—without dropping a single lead. Why AI Assisted Leadgen Works Better We build lead funnels that turn prospects into booked appointments. Here's how the system works: First, we identify a lead magnet your target customers can't resist—a checklist, guide, calculator, or resource they'll download without hesitation. Next, we design a landing page built for conversions. We target 20% conversion rates or higher. Most agencies celebrate 5%—we don't stop there. Then we create an email sequence that reads like a personal conversation, not a mass blast. Each message nurtures leads progressively until they're ready for a call. By syncing with your calendar, we skip the back-and-forth email threads and let qualified leads book time with you directly. We also handle all the tracking. You'll see exactly what's working and where to improve—no guesswork. Pricing $1,499 setup + $299/mo Complete lead generation system Transparent pricing. We build the system, manage it, and keep your pipeline full. Get Started Most customers get their first qualified lead in under a week. Three Channels, One System Most businesses only use one or two of these channels. We connect all three so you capture every lead—no matter where a prospect first discovers you. Website Chatbot Engages visitors at the right moment, asks qualifying questions, and books appointments—all on autopilot, 24/7. Never miss a lead again Facebook Messenger 1.3 billion people use Messenger every month. Reach prospects on a platform they already use and trust—with instant, automated responses. Instant response, any time of day LinkedIn Automation Finds prospects who match your criteria, engages with their content through meaningful comments and shares, and starts conversations that lead to sales. Warm introductions at scale Common Questions Is this chatbot different from the one I already have? Most chatbots handle basic FAQ-style questions and stop there. Ours is a sales tool. It qualifies visitors through a natural conversation, collects their contact information, and books appointments on your calendar—without you lifting a finger. One client told us their old bot felt like a vending machine. Ours works more like a top sales rep who never clocks out. What if I already have a CRM? We integrate with all major CRM platforms—HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, and more. Every conversation and data point flows directly into your existing setup. Your team gets full visibility, and leads never have to repeat themselves. Facebook Messenger sounds complicated. Is it? Not at all—this is one of our strengths. Here's a typical scenario: someone messages your Facebook page at 3 AM. Your AI assistant responds instantly, asks a few qualifying questions, and if they're a fit, books a call at their convenience. They pick a slot from your calendar, and it's done. You wake up to a calendar full of qualified appointments. I have tried LinkedIn automation before and it felt spammy. We understand that concern completely. Generic bots that blast the same message to everyone are ineffective and damage your reputation. Our approach is different. We identify individuals who match your ideal customer profile, engage with their content through thoughtful and relevant comments, and then open genuine conversations. The result is warm introductions—not cold spam. How long does it take to see the results? Timeline depends on your current traffic levels. That said, most clients see their first qualified lead within the first week. The system also improves over time—it learns what converts best for your specific business. By week three or four, you'll typically have a steady flow of leads coming in without any extra effort on your end. What if I want to change things after the launch? During the first month, all modifications are included at no extra cost. After that, changes are billed at reasonable hourly rates. We don't disappear after launch—you'll get regular updates on performance and optimizations. Most clients stay with us not because of a contract, but because the system delivers consistent results. The Number One Reason Leads Get Lost It's response time. If a lead doesn't hear back within 5 minutes, the chance of conversion drops by 10x. People get distracted, lose interest, or find a competitor who responded faster. One gym owner we work with put it this way: \"I was losing 5 to 10 leads every week because I couldn't respond fast enough. Now I wake up to appointments already on my calendar.\" Book Your Discovery Call 15 minutes, no pressure. We'll discuss your goals and see if we're the right fit.",
